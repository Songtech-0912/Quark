# Pyrite

A fast and beautiful editor, powered by `Eel` and `Python`. Download it and try it out [here](release_notes/release-0.1.1-alpha.md).

## Announcement :warning:

Pyrite is undergoing a redesign and a complete UI overhaul. All frontend code will be rewritten from scratch with OpenGL and `Pyglet` for speed. The main goal of this refactoring is to make Pyrite fully responsive, and to improve the UI design to match modern standards. You can see my design progress [here](https://www.figma.com/file/mtD74sP2xBowI0fK4n1rZU/Pyrite-Mockups?node-id=0%3A1). Once V2 is released, Pyrite will also change to a public domain license for minimal licensing hassle.

In addition to this major change, Pyrite will also implement a code of conduct for the first time. This will be the [SCoC](https://github.com/Songtech-0912/SCoC). The terms of this code of conduct are highly permissive and encourage good behavior without radicalizing the community.

## Overview

![Screenshot](markdown_assets/hero-image.png)

> Note: It has come to my attention that another developer has previously written a Python text editor of the same name. I did not intend to plagiarize the name of his editor. You can check out his editor [here](https://github.com/zcking/Pyrite).

Pyrite's name sounds like "PyWrite" - because it's designed from the ground up for writing code. Unlike electron-based editors, it doesn't suffer from node package bloat. And, unlike most widget-based editors, its UI is polished and themable. 

Here's what PyRite offers:

* Fast file opening speeds, even on very large files (More testing needed to verify this!) 
* Minimal memory use
* File autosaving (Will come soon!)
* Syntax highlighting of most languages (Will come soon!)
* Support for multiple themes (Will come soon!)
* Minimalist and distraction-free feature set

Learn more about Pyrite on its [website](https://songtech-0912.github.io/Pyrite/).

### Built with

* HTML & CSS (no SASS or LESS) 
* Mostly (>96%) vanilla javascript, with no libraries (except for `keyboard.js`)
* Python & `Eel`

### FAQ

* How is Pyrite different from an editor that I'm used to?

Unlike most text editors, the main point of using Pyrite isn't to have all the best and coolest features. Instead, it's meant to be distraction-free and minimalist. It makes you focus on the code that you're writing, *not* what you write the code with.

* Why is \<insert feature here\> not available?

Pyrite is *designed* to be extremely minimal, with very few configuration options. With that being said though, many features (e.g. find and replace) will come in the future releases.

* What are the keybindings?

There are (as of now) three custom (Pyrite-specific) keyboard shortcuts:

**Save:** `Alt S`

**Save Copy:** `Alt C`

**Create New:** `Alt N`

In addition, these generic keyboard functions will also work:

**Undo:** `Ctrl Z`

**Redo:** `Ctrl Shift Z`

**Copy:** `Ctrl C`

**Cut:** `Ctrl X`

**Paste:** `Ctrl V`

**Select All:**  `Ctrl A`

* I want to use Pyrite for my own projects. Can I do that?

Yes, sure! Because Pyrite is free and open-source software, you're more than welcome to use it for personal purposes. You can even sell it, as long as you place no limitations upon its use.


## Download & Install

If you want a ready-to-use version of Pyrite, grab the latest version from the [releases page](https://github.com/Songtech-0912/Pyrite/releases).

Otherwise, follow these steps:

### Get the source code

You must have `git` preinstalled to do this. For information on how to install `git`, read [this](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) page.

Assuming that you have `git`, run this command:

```
git clone https://github.com/Songtech-0912/Pyrite
cd Pyrite
```

### Running from source

You don't actually need to compile Pyrite for it to run. You just need to have `python` and `pip` installed.

First, install `python` from [its website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Next, get `pip` from [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).

Once you have Python and Pip installed, just run this:

```
pip install eel
```

```
cd src
python main.py
```

### Compiling executables

Compiling executables requires `pyinstaller`. Get `pyinstaller` like this:

```
pip install pyinstaller
```

Once you have `pyinstaller` installed, open a terminal in your `Pyrite` source code directory. Paste this command in:

```
python -m eel main.py gui --onefile --noconsole --name Pyrite --exclude pyinstaller
```

### With a Virtual Environment (Currently MacOS and GNU/Linux only)

You can use a virtual environment to run pyinstaller (especially if you have a lot of Python packages). To do this, open a terminal in your `Pyrite` source code directory, and enter in this:

```
cd ..
```

Then enter in this in your terminal (without the dollar signs):

```
$ cp Pyrite env
$ python3 -m venv env
$ source env/bin/activate
```

We have to install `pyinstaller` and `eel` before doing any compiling. Use the same commands as before, or copy the two listed below (without dollar signs):

```
$ pip install eel
$ pip install pyinstaller
```

Now, you're ready to start compiling. To compile, enter the main folder, and run the same `pyinstaller` command as before:

```
cd env
python -m eel main.py gui --onefile --noconsole --name Pyrite --exclude pyinstaller
```

Your compiled executable will be located in `./dist`.

## Problems

### Known Issues

Pyrite is known to suffer from several issues, listed below:

* Paste errors
* File being edited is not highlighted
* Font/rendering issues

If you find any other issues, please open an issue on Github. I would greatly appreciate it.

### Troubleshooting

Had a problem installing or running Pyrite? Here are some ways to solve it

* Close localhost ports

By default, Pyrite will use any opened port for its GUI, but if that isn't possible, you can try closing all localhost ports

* Install Chrome/Chromium/any Blink-based browser

Pyrite will work best with Chrome/Chromium preinstalled. Some of its features may not work if you don't have it.

* Launch Pyrite from terminal

Open up a terminal and `cd` into the folder where you downloaded Pyrite. Give it executable priviledges with `chmod a+x`. Then run `./Pyrite` or `Pyrite` (depending on your OS) to launch it.
